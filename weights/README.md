Weights
========

This directory contains the neural network files, which are used by lc0. 
[Leelenstein 15](https://www.patreon.com/posts/leelenstein-15-0-38164065) is provided as default network, but other network files can be downloaded from the [official website](https://github.com/LeelaChessZero/lc0/wiki/Best-Nets-for-Lc0).

To use another network with lc0, simply:

1. Download the .pb.gz network file you want to use
2. Move the file to this directory
3. Edit the weights entry in ../settings/lc0.config to point to the newly added file
